# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark

This folder contains a standalone script that compares the **real-world performance** of all sorting algorithms implemented in this repository.

The goal: see the actual difference between theoretical time complexity (O(n²), O(n log n), etc.) and practical execution time on random data.

## 🚀 How to Run the Benchmark

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Only one external library: `matplotlib` (for generating the chart)

Install the dependency with a single command:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
# execution
```
git clone https://github.com/amineTNYT/Sorting-algorithms.git
cd Sorting-algorithms
python benchmark/benchmark.py
```
